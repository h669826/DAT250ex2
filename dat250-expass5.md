Yeah i used most my time trying to fix my project structure, and got kinda far from last project, still has some bugs
with the cache i implemented so i put it in a seperate branch as to not make the tests fail on the main branch on git.
The Redis work side is again not an issue but an overly complicated project makes implementing new functionality
difficult.

Still need to fic the pollController to work correctly
